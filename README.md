## Development Process

This software was commisioned as part of in the SWE & QA course @ Haifa University.

Implemented in Java 19, using an OOP approach. 

  We emphasized adherence to SOLID principles as our core learning goal (to help write maintainable and extendable software)
  
Work was done in a SCRUM methodology with a planning phase and 3 sprints. SCRUM roles were rotated.

Code was written in IntelliJ IDEA and Version Control was done... in this very repo :)
