    //hi Tom
    //my Board model needs to know the difficulty, because difficulty translates to tile grid size and how many mines will be placed
    //so when you create a Board object, please send it the needed knowledge
    //-ohad
// i also created an ENUM to hold all static values of each dificulty. here is how you can use it:
   //  GameSession session = new GameSession(Difficulty);
//
}
